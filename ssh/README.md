# SSH Scripts

This folder contains a collection of shell scripts for controlling the Raspberry Pi photo frame remotely.
These are intended for the situation where your Raspberry Pi is running with a monitor connected
but no keyboard or mouse, and you want to be able to control the photo frame from another computer.
